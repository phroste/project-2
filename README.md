##Wireframes

##User Stories
A user can enter in a movie title that they are looking forward to watch. They can add/update it to the movies to watch list. In the edit page, a user can edit/update the movie with their 'anticipation' rating towards that specific movie, ranging from 1-100. The user can click on the individual movies pages and delete them as well.

##The approach taken
Friday - Wireframe/pseudocode, test API/make ajax calls to API. Set up boilerplate.
Saturday - Set up database. Flesh out Express MVC model - set up controller and view.
Sunday - Continue from yesterday. Build out routes and models.
Monday - Continue. Start styling html.
Tuesday - Plan presentation, README, work out any remaining bugs
Wednesday - Review presentation and finish up README/bugs
